# Ratemate

The goal of this little jQuery plugin is to provide a rating widget wrapping the HTML5 meter and input[type=number] elements. The rating will be displayed and/or controlled using a Raphaël canvas.

This plugin is being developed in CoffeeScript. Grab the compiled jQuery plugin from src/compiled/.

## Requirements

Ratemate is being developed using jQuery 1.4.4 and Raphaël 1.5.2. These libraries can be found via their websites or in the lib/ directory of this project.
